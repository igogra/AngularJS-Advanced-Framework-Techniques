#User Story

As a user, I want text saved using the Factory to set strings that contain an odd number of characters to be lower case, and even number of characters to be upper case so that I can easily see which inputs are odd or even number of characters.

##Acceptance Criteria

- If the input parameter is an even number of characters, return the Upper Case value of that string
- If the input parameter is an odd number of characters, return the Lower Case value of that string
- A formattingFactory will be created that will handle the above formatting.
- The Save With Factory button will use the new formattingFactory factory.
