#User Story

As a user, I want the ability to display a list of Authors and view the detail when I click on the Details button so that I can learn about various authors.

##Acceptance Criteria

- The directive displays the Name, Nationality, and Dates of each Author in the first three columns
- Add a Details button in the fourth column which will display an alert to the user with the author Name
- When the mouse is over the row, set the background to silver
- When the mouse leaves the row, set the background back to white
