#User Story

As a user, I want the ability to select a date with a date picker that is either today's date or in the future and display the selected date so that I can see the selected date.

##Acceptance Criteria

- A Datepicker control is displayed on the page
- The Datepicker control is initially bound to today's date
- Don't allow dates in the past
- Hide the week numbers
- Display the selected date in a <pre> tag and apply the date filter
